# Decentralized Manufacturing Molecular Assembly

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing molecular-level manufacturing processes using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This system provides a decentralized framework for molecular manufacturing that includes facility verification, assembly protocols, quality control, scalability tracking, and innovation development. Each component is implemented as a separate smart contract to ensure modularity and maintainability.

## System Architecture

### Core Contracts

1. **Facility Verification Contract** (`facility-verification.clar`)
    - Validates and manages molecular manufacturing sites
    - Tracks facility metrics and certifications
    - Manages facility status and verification processes

2. **Assembly Protocol Contract** (`assembly-protocol.clar`)
    - Manages molecular-level production protocols
    - Handles protocol creation, activation, and execution
    - Tracks assembly parameters and execution results

3. **Quality Verification Contract** (`quality-verification.clar`)
    - Ensures molecular precision and quality standards
    - Manages batch quality verification
    - Certifies quality verifiers and maintains standards

4. **Scalability Tracking Contract** (`scalability-tracking.clar`)
    - Monitors production scaling and capacity management
    - Tracks production metrics and efficiency scores
    - Manages scaling targets and network capacity

5. **Innovation Development Contract** (`innovation-development.clar`)
    - Manages molecular manufacturing advancement and research
    - Handles project funding and milestone tracking
    - Publishes research results and manages researcher profiles

## Key Features

### Facility Management
- Register and verify manufacturing facilities
- Track facility metrics (uptime, quality, production volume)
- Manage certifications and compliance status
- Monitor facility performance over time

### Protocol Management
- Create and manage assembly protocols
- Define molecular formulas and assembly steps
- Set temperature, pressure, and duration parameters
- Track protocol executions and success rates

### Quality Assurance
- Submit batches for quality verification
- Set quality standards per protocol
- Certify quality verifiers
- Track molecular purity, structural integrity, and contamination levels

### Scalability Monitoring
- Record production metrics by facility and period
- Set and track scaling targets
- Monitor network-wide capacity and utilization
- Calculate performance scores and efficiency metrics

### Innovation & Research
- Propose and fund innovation projects
- Track project milestones and progress
- Publish research results and improvements
- Manage researcher profiles and reputation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Node.js for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd molecular-assembly
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Run tests:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm test
   \`\`\`

### Deployment

Deploy contracts to Stacks testnet:
\`\`\`bash
clarinet deploy --testnet
\`\`\`

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Facility
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .facility-verification register-facility
"Lab Complex A, Building 1"
u1000
(list "ISO-9001" "GMP" "Molecular-Cert"))
\`\`\`

### Creating an Assembly Protocol
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .assembly-protocol create-protocol
"Carbon Nanotube Assembly"
"C60H30"
(list "Heat substrate" "Apply catalyst" "Molecular deposition")
u300 u400  ;; temperature range
u1 u5      ;; pressure range
u120)      ;; duration in minutes
\`\`\`

### Submitting Quality Batch
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .quality-verification submit-batch
u1    ;; facility-id
u1    ;; protocol-id
u1    ;; execution-id
u95   ;; purity percentage
u98   ;; integrity percentage
u2    ;; contamination percentage
"High quality batch with minimal impurities")
\`\`\`

## Contract Interactions

The contracts are designed to work together:

1. Facilities must be verified before executing protocols
2. Protocol executions generate quality batches
3. Quality verification affects facility metrics
4. Scalability tracking uses data from all other contracts
5. Innovation projects can improve protocols and processes

## Security Considerations

- Admin functions are restricted to contract owners
- Facility owners can only update their own facilities
- Quality verifiers must be certified
- All state changes are logged on-chain
- Input validation prevents invalid data entry

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests using Vitest:

\`\`\`bash
npm run test
\`\`\`

Tests cover:
- Contract deployment and initialization
- Function calls with valid and invalid parameters
- State changes and data integrity
- Access control and permissions
- Integration between contracts
